Numerical Music/Recommendations/Robots
• Implemented MATLAB audio synthesis and processing with oscillators, ADSR envelopes,
convolution-based reverb, high-pass filtering, and spectrogram analysis.
• Implemented a recommendation system in MATLAB that reads user-item data from CSV, prepro-
cesses sparse entries, applies SVD for dimensionality reduction, and generates top-N theme recom-
mendations using cosine similarity.
• Developed MATLAB scripts for robot trajectory interpolation using Vandermonde and cubic spline
polynomials, including data parsing, coefficient computation, and visualization of smooth trajecto-
ries.
